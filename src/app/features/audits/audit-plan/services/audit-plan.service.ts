/* ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Legacy mock plans — the fallback for every company id that doesn't have
 * a real, adapter-backed audit plan. These ids ('crowe-uae', 'crowe-ksa',
 * ...) are from the old hardcoded audit-plan-selector company list and no
 * longer match any real company id, since the selector now sources
 * companies from CompanyDataService (real ids like 'dar-exchange',
 * 'al-noor-jewellery', etc).
 *
 * getPlan() below only takes the real-company/adapter path under
 * CLIENT_MODE_VALUE === 'internal-audit' — the one mode where
 * AUDIT_SCOPE_STATIC_COMPANIES (→ SCOPE_INDI_ORG_COMPANIES) and
 * MOCK_SCOPE_JOBS (→ DAR_EXCHANGE_SCOPE_JOBS, generated from those same
 * companies' Approved scopes) actually agree on scope ids. In every other
 * client mode, AUDIT_SCOPE_STATIC_COMPANIES resolves to the multi-company
 * AUDIT_FIRM_SCOPE_COMPANIES roster, but MOCK_SCOPE_JOBS stays the small
 * hardcoded AUDIT_FIRM_SCOPE_JOBS list (unrelated scope ids) — routing
 * those companies through the adapter filters every one of their scopes
 * out for lack of a matching job, so the Audit Plan pages show nothing.
 * Keeping this gate mode-specific means every other client mode keeps
 * showing exactly the legacy/mock data it always did.
 *
 * Replace this whole file's mock path with the real API call when the
 * backend is ready — see getPlan() below.
