/**
 * ============================================================================
 *  Internal-audit-mode Company -> Branch -> Department -> Scope -> Sub-scope
 *  directory — same OrgCompany/OrgBranch/OrgDepartment/OrgDeptScope/
 *  OrgSubScope/OrgTask shape as ORG_STATIC_DATA (company-org-data.ts), built
 *  from the DAR Exchange / XYZ Broadcast single-org seed files
 *  (company/department/audit-scope *-static-indi-org.data.ts).
 *
 *  Company/Branch/Department listing (names, codes, contact info, ...) is
 *  sourced from department-static-indi-org.data.ts's DEPARTMENT_INDI_ORG_COMPANIES
 *  — the same file the Departments module itself reads from — so this
 *  adapter's department list can never drift from what the Departments list
 *  page actually shows (it previously read branch-static-indi-org.data.ts's
 *  own inline department list instead, which had gone stale/out of sync for
 *  XYZ Broadcast: department-static-indi-org.data.ts had trimmed its XYZ
 *  roster down to 5 real departments while the branch file still listed all
 *  27 draft ones). Each department's Scope -> Sub-scope -> Task detail still
 *  comes from audit-scope-static-indi-org.data.ts's SCOPE_INDI_ORG_COMPANIES
 *  (richer than department-static-indi-org.data.ts's own `scopes` preview —
 *  it carries tasks), matched by branchCode::departmentName.
 *
 *  Any page that reads ORG_STATIC_DATA can switch to
 *  ORG_STATIC_DATA_INTERNAL_AUDIT when CLIENT_MODE is 'internal-audit'
 *  without any other code changes — see findings-list.component.ts's
 *  `orgData` computed for the pattern (same CLIENT_MODE ? … : … switch
 *  CompanyDataService already uses for COMPANIES_SEED).
