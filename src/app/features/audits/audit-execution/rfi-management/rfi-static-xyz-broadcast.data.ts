// Self-contained static RFI data for the XYZ Broadcast internal-audit client —
// same shape, helpers and field set as rfi-static-indi.data.ts (the ABC
// Broadcast internal-audit seed); only the org data differs.
//
// The company/division/sub-division/scope skeleton mirrors the XYZ Broadcast seeds:
//   - company:       Admin/company-static-xyz-broadcast.data.ts (xyz-broadcast)
//   - division:      apps/divisions/division-static-xyz-broadcast.data.ts (XYZ-BR-01 Dubai)
//   - sub-divisions: apps/sub-divisions/sub-division-static-xyz-broadcast.data.ts (5 sub-divisions)
//   - scopes:        apps/audit-scope-management/audit-scope-static-xyz-org.data.ts
//                    (one top-level scope per sub-division — SC-70NN — with its
//                    sub-scopes SC-70NN-S1.. as flat sibling records keyed by
//                    `parentScopeId`)
//
// RFIs hang off the sub-scopes, one per RFI ID from the Media Company Internal
// Audit plan (RFI-BO-001 .. RFI-FI-002) whose sub-scope is active in the scope
// seed. Top-level scopes carry `rfis: []` so getAllEnrichedRfis() can resolve
// each sub-scope's parent label. Statuses span all 5 `RfiStatus` values;
// 3 of the 4 completed RFIs carry a rejected-round response history, and every
// reopened RFI's history includes the round that was rejected.
//
// Company/division/sub-division/scope OPTION LISTS below read the REAL sources
// (division-static-data.ts / sub-division-static-data.ts / audit-scope-static-data.ts)
// rather than this file's own wrapper arrays, exactly as rfi-static-indi.data.ts does.
