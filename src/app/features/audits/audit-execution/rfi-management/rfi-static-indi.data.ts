// Self-contained static data for RFI Management (both the auditor view
// `rfi-management.ts` and the client view `rfi-management-client.ts`) — like
// sub-division-static-data.ts / division-static-data.ts / audit-scope-static-data.ts,
// this does NOT read `crowe_all_static_extended.json` at bootstrap; everything
// it renders is compiled into the bundle from here.
//
// The company/division/sub-division/scope/sub-scope skeleton below is a trimmed,
// independently-authored copy of the same content as
// `apps/audit-scope-management/audit-scope-static-data.ts` (same 8 companies —
// ids/tags/colors — same divisions, sub-divisions, and 106 scope/sub-scope
// records/ids/names), so RFI Management's filters stay consistent with Audit
// Scope Management's filters. As in that file, scopes and sub-scopes are NOT
// nested — they're a single flat `scopes[]` per sub-division, differentiated
// only by `parentScopeId` (null = top-level scope, set = sub-scope of that id).
//
// Each scope/sub-scope carries a `rfis: StaticRfi[]` array of real RFI content
// (title, description, due date, owner, status, questionnaire, response,
// response history) harvested from `crowe_all_static_extended.json` and
// distributed round-robin across every scope/sub-scope slot — the JSON's own
// RFIs are ~99.6% concentrated under two sub-division templates ("Finance &
// Accounting" / "Compliance & Risk"), so real content is pooled and spread
// across all scopes rather than matched by original sub-division label. Every
// RFI here is unmodified real content; only the `id` (globally unique) and
// `auditorIds` (seeded from the owning scope's own `assignedAuditors`) are
// generated.
//
// Company/division/sub-division/scope OPTION LISTS below read the REAL sources
// (CompanyDataService / division-static-data.ts / sub-division-static-data.ts /
// audit-scope-static-data.ts) rather than this file's own company/division/
// sub-division/scope wrapper arrays, so a company/division/sub-division/scope added
// via those other pages is selectable here immediately. Only the RFI content
// itself (`rfis: StaticRfi[]`) lives in this file's own tree.
