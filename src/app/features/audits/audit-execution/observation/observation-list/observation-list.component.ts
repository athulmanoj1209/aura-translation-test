// static data used by the Add Member modal, Members list, Companies list,
// Add Risk drawer, Risk Register, Scope Jobs and Evidence Repository
// filters) instead of being scraped off whatever values happen to appear
// on MOCK — so the filter always offers the full canonical list. Division
// narrows to the selected Company's divisions and Sub-Division narrows to
// the selected Company+Division's sub-divisions, same cascading behaviour as
// those other pages. Adjust the '@/app/data/company-org-data' path if
// that file lives elsewhere.
//
// In 'internal-audit' mode, Division/Sub-Division instead come from the
// DAR Exchange division/sub-division catalog (division-static-indi-org.data.ts
// / sub-division-static-indi-org.data.ts) rather than company-org-data.ts —
// see the CLIENT_MODE_VALUE check inside divisionOptions/subDivisionOptions
// below.
//
// Observation.company / Observation.division / Observation.subDivision are
// plain display-name strings (not ids/codes), so the option *values* here
// are the company/division/sub-division *names* themselves. The 12 seed MOCK
// records below have been aligned to real companies/divisions/sub-divisions
// from company-org-data.ts (they previously used unrelated placeholder
// names like 'Crowe UAE' / 'Dubai' / 'Finance', which never matched
// anything and would have made these filters show zero records too).
//
// The Scope filter (scopeOptions below) is still *computed* by scraping
// distinct values off this.observations() — same mechanism as the Evidence
// Repository list's Scope filter — but the 12 seed records' scope/subscope
// values have now been remapped from generic audit-category placeholders
// ('Internal Audit'/'Financial Controls', 'External Audit'/'Tax Audit', ...)
// to real per-sub-division Scope/Sub-scope names taken from each record's
// (already-aligned) company/division/sub-division in company-org-data.ts (e.g.
// OBS-005's AML vendor-screening finding now sits under Al Waha Construction
// & Contracting / Legal & Governance's real 'AML/CFT Compliance Review' →
// 'Walkthrough Testing' scope/sub-scope, not an invented category). So the
// filter's option list is populated with real, cross-checked scope names,
// even though the computed function itself doesn't call ORG_STATIC_DATA
// directly.
//
// The "+ New Observation" / Edit drawer (AddObservationComponent) is now
// wired the same way (Company/Division/Sub-Division cascading, plus the fully
// cascading Company→Division→Sub-Division→Scope→Sub-scope picker, like Add
// Evidence's drawer already had). Its option *values* are the same
// company/division/sub-division/scope/subscope *names* used here, so the old
// COMPANY_LABELS/DIVISION_LABELS/SUBDIVISION_LABELS code-translation layer
// (crowe_uae -> 'Crowe UAE', dubai -> 'Dubai', ...) that used to bridge
// between its local codes and these display names is gone — openAdd() and
// openEdit() below now pass company/division/subDivision/scope/subscope
// straight through instead of translating.
